# Spotify-API-Client
This is a Spotify API client I created that has the ability to automatically refresh tokens and comes with robust search functionality. I tcomes with 2 versions: **version 1 (../client/Spotify_Client.py)** uses the client credentials flow auth process from spotify and **version 2 (../client/Spotify_Client_V2.py)**

There are a lot of features that will be built onto this project but this is the initial description. Check Readme for more information.
